ELLE is a simple HTML5 and CSS generator.

Motivation and design goals:
I hate writing HTML and CSS and would rather describe a layout in english.
My intention is to keep it as simple as possible. Initialization should create a skeletal HTML5     file and corresponding CSS file. Method invocations should create HTML elements, assign that        element a class, and generate CSS for that element.

One HTML file.

One CSS file.

That's it.

Oh and I could care less about compability with IE.

HTML5 only.

Deal with it.



Possible some-day-features:

integrate with S2JS or other scala to javascript library
animation - possibly with/like processing??

Non-Textual DSL Aspect - as in a Visual layout Language - now there's a novel idea. Or should I say mural idea.
